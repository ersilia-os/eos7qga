    "Description": "This implementation presents 4 ways in which molecules can be represented given a smile using the DATAMOL package. This model receives a SMILE as input, then goes through a process of disinfection and standardization of the molecule, to generate Canonical smiles, selfies, inchi and inchi key (the newest version of inchi).",

    "Interpretation": "In this implementation, python version 3.8 is used to be able to work with the Datamol python library. For the preprocessing of a molecule, everything that involves the process of sanitizing and standardizing to obtain the representation forms of a smile. Datamol provides a function called _preprocess, given a smile, it converts to a mole, corrects the errors, sanitizes it and standardizes, returning a molecule ready to be converted into its canonical representation, selfies, inchi and inchi key. The default values used for sanitize de mol were: For the snitize_mol function: the default parameters were: sanifix= True and charge_neutral=False. For standardize_mol, the default parameters were: disconnect_metals=False, normalize=True, reionize=True, uncharge=False, stereo=True",
